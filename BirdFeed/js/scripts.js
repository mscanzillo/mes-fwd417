// TODO: Is there a loading spinner I can use? How do i use it?
async function handleSpeciesRequest(e) {
    // Make API request with relevant region code 
}

// Add event listener to the submit button, get species searched for when submitted
// How do i make sure i'm submitting the species code vs. the species name? should i show a preset list of species? Is there a vanilla JS component I can use for that?
